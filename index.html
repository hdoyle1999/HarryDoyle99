								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello my name is Harry Doyle, I am 25 years old and I am from Cork, living in Dublin. In 2022 I graduated from my Intgerated Masters in Trinity College Dublin doing Computer Science. I have studied many modules varying from telecommunications to software engineering so I have knowledge of both low and high level computer systems. I have experience in mainly high level programming languages such as Java, Python, C and I am planning on learing C#, HTML, CSS and Javascript in my own time soon. But I have also done ARM assembly language, XML, VHDL and others<br/><br/><br/></p>
								<p>As I have stated I plan on learning HTML, CSS and Javascript and thus this website came along, a place I could put my learning to test but also a place I could document my progress in other projects for personal use. I hope to continue improving this website and adding new features to it. So if you are interseted keep updated and follow my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrydoyle99/"> my LinkedIn </a>.</p>
								<p>If you want to follow my progress in my other compouter related projects check out the <a href="#Projects">Projects</a> tab or if you just want to know what I do for fun continue reading here.<br/> 
									I am quite sporty I enjoy playing soccer, golf and tennis. I used to play soccer competitively but I had to give up when i moved to a boarding school that didnt play soccer I also used to do athletics, both long and short distance running and long jump. <br/>
									I also like being creative like working with wood and doing technical graphics (which is something I plan on getting back into more and possibly doing a few projects) and I think my creativity could have lead to my enjoyment for programmming, I find it fascinating finding the differnet ways of working around a problem and implementing them in my concept. <br/>
									Another thing I love that stemmed my love for Computer Science, is my love for travelling I have lived in many differnent countries such as Barbados and St. Lucia. The possibilty of working remotely and travelling to new countries really appeals to me.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Time Series Forecasting</h2>
								<span class = "video"></span><video width="560" height = "320" controls> <source src = "images/sweng.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video></span>
								<p>In my module for Software Engineering project, 6 classmates and I were tasked with creating a time series forecasting software for our client Microsoft. This was my first time using Python and also programming a fully functional webapp so i faced may new learning adventures. </p>
								<p>My first task was of course to learn the Python language and learn how its syntax worked, once i saw how easy and satisying Python was to work in I knew it was going to quickly become my go to langauge. I plan on doing more personal Python projects in my own time. <br>
								My next task was to learn what time series forecasting was and what it involved, Time series forecasting is the use of datasets to predict the value of a given element at a future date. This was my first time working with a large dataset and first time doing a data science project and i knew immediately i was goiong to face some severe challenges.<br></p>
								<p>My main focus in this project was to develop a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. SVR tries to find a line in space that seperates the dataset and predicts the asked value by seeing if the points fall on the negative or positive side of the line</p>
							
								<h2 class="major">This Website</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I really wanted to learn HTML and CSS, so idecide for my first personal project I decided I would create a portfolio website where friends and colleagues could check out my projects and follow along with the developemnt of them. </p>
								<p>This website is still under going changes and I hope to maybe implement some cool features by using Javascript. I began by experimenting with pure HTML and CSS seeing what effects you could program. Once i got the hang of it I started trying to implement them into a nice and responsive design but struggled in making one so i got this template of HTML5up, however i do plan on creating my own template once I am ready and fully understand CSS. I also want to learn Javascript and create new animations and effects to use in the website, so stay tuned to see what I have done.</p>

								<h3> Software Engineer</h3>
								<p>Currently I currentl am a software engineering. I really enjoy programming in high level langauges and using object orientated programming to make interesting programs and algorithms. I hope to further develop my skills as a software engineer in the coming future. <br> <br></p>
								<h3>Web Design</h3>
								<p>In the begins of the website i really enjoyed it but struggled with a few things but was able to overcome them but i am going to hvae to wait and see if i enjoy improving and maintaining this website enough to consider it as a career path.<br> <br></p>
